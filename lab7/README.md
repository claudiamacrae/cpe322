# Lab 7 â€” ThingSpeak and Google Sheets
## Part 1
I ran thingspeak_cpu_loop.py and thingspeak_feed.py in a demo folder to collect and upload data about my cpu performance.
```console
pi@ctmpi: ~/demo $ python3 thingspeak_feed.py

## Part 2
I installed gspread and oauth2client, and created a new Google Cloud Platform service account with a JSON key file, in order to use Google SHeets API calls. By prepping a new sheet and running cpu_spreadsheet.py, I was able to upload the data collected in Part 1 to Google Drive.
```console
pi@ctmpi: ~/demo $ python3 rpi_spreadsheet.py
